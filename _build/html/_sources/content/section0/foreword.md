# Bike-Sharing in the United States

There is a growing need in urban spaces for alternatives to traditional modes of transportation, due to a convergence of factors such as: increase in urban population density, over-impacted public transportation systems, endemic air pollution, imperatives to curb greenhouse gas emissions, and prohibitive costs of car ownership.

[Micromobility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micromobility), fully or partially human-powered vehicles such as bikes or scooters operating at speeds under 25 km/h (15 mph), can fill some of the urban transportation gaps. It is a rapidly growing industry, accounting for 84 million trips in 2018, twice the number of trips compared to the previous year<sup>[1](#myfootnote1)</sup>. Its market-size was valued at USD 3.1 billion in 2018, with a forecasted compound annual growth rate of 17% as of 2020<sup>[2](#myfootnote2)</sup>.

Bike-sharing predominates in large, densely populated metropoles such as New York City, accounting for 40% of all bike trips in 2017 alone<sup>[3](#myfootnote3)</sup>. Six cities accounted for 84% of all station-based bike share trips in 2018 (see plot below):

According to an industry firm's study, micromobile options such as bikes and scooters could replace 50% of short-distance (0-3 miles) vehicle trips in the U.S.<sup>[4](#myfootnote4)</sup>. In its ranking of U.S. cities with the greatest micromobility potential (including efficient and cost-effective travel, reduced traffic congestion, decreased emissions and a boost to the local economy), the firm ranked San Francisco in 10th<sup>[5](#myfootnote5)</sup>.

While bike-sharing systems tend to be public-private partnerships, ridesharing companies Lyft and Uber have entered the micromobility market, and seek to set the tone for the industry. Uber's strategy, for instance, is to build and own the whole of the transportation's "ecosystem" into its app, providing an array of transportation modes ranging from rideshare to electric scooters and bikes. To do so, private companies need to approach city's officials with tact, and make the case for their services as beneficiary to public transit infrastructure<sup>[6](#myfootnote6)</sup>.

Although the market of micromobility is still maturing, it remains to be seen how the industry will evolve with the disturbances of daily-life brought upon by the COVID-19 pandemic.


## Docked Vs. Dockless Fleets

The formative model of bike-sharing was docked: rent a docked-bike at a pick-station, and drop-it off at the nearest drop-off station to your destination. Dockless bikes remove this barrier, since these bikes are not bounded to a station. This has the advantage of widening the scope of mobility for commuters, requiring just the app to geolocate and borrow the nearest bike. However this poses challenges for operators (in terms of durability, maintenance etc.) and cities, such as added clutter on sidewalks (an issue similar to the highly publicized roll-out of e-scooters, for instance).

Dockless bikes are designed for short, spontaneous trips, such as a commuter first-or-last mile option. They also present a much cheaper alternative to a potential bus trip or traditional bike share daily pricing scheme<sup>[7](#myfootnote7)</sup>.
