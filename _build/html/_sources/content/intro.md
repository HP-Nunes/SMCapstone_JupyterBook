## About me

<img align="left" width="200" height="183" style="margin-right:25px" src="https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/32919932"> I hold a BA in Geography with a minor in Geospatial Information & Technology from UC Berkeley, and a Master of Environment in Environmental Assessment from Concordia University. I began my reconversion towards data science in 2018, motivated by the imperative to enhance my GIS skillset using programmatic methods for data analytical processes. I joined SharpestMinds in 2020 under the mentorship of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikhail-sidyakov/" target="_blank">Mikhail Sidyakov</a> to further expand my base knowledge of data science in the job market.
