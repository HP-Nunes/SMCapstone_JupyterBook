<h2>Bikes Are Not For Going Out On a Walk, More Like a Short Drive</h2>

Since Euclidean Distance represents a minimal, straight line distance between two points, it ought to be interpreted as a <em>minimal baseline</em> of travelled distance, whereas true distance is affected by a myriad of factors such as road directionality, traffic, elevation changes, and individual choices to name a few.

We also learn that the majority of trips, roughly 7 in 10, take place between 'docking' stations. Only e-bikes can be stationed 'dockless', and we note that out of those types of trips, roughly half are pick-up rides whose pick-up and drop-off locations did not involve docking an e-bike onto a station (note the following caveat: e-bikes may very well be stationed dockless in spite of being in close proximity to a docking station; it can happen that if those docks are full, e-bikes will be stationed in proximity to that station, as Bay Wheels waives dockless stationing fees in those types of situations).
