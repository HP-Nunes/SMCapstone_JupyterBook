# SharpestMinds Capstone 
Data Analysis of Lyft's Bay Wheels in San Francisco
+++
---

**This is my capstone deliverable for my SharpestMinds data fellowship, which consists of multi-faceted, in-depth analysis of Lyft's bikesharing dataset from 2019 to 2021, in addition to predictive modelling.**

---
## Overview

Bay Wheels, Lyft's bikesharing service for the San Francisco Bay Area, has gone through several upheaval in the city of San Francisco over the past few years, some of which include: rebranding, the failed launch of its e-bike fleet in 2019, the effect of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, and public discontent caused by changes in its pricing scheme. Yet Bay Wheels continues to expand its coverage throughout San Francisco's hilly landscape, unhindered by the city's pleasant Mediterranean climate.

## Learning objectives

My personal learning objectives for this project are:

* To refine and iterate upon my ETL process for big data;

* To familiarize myself with data engineering tools and apps, such as PySpark and Databricks;

* To apply Machine methods for predictive analysis,and understand how to evaluate them;

* To make use of effective data visualizations to reveal trends from a multidimensional dataset.

I began my reconversion towards data science in 2018, motivated by the imperative to enhance my GIS skillset using programmatic methods for data analytical processes. I joined SharpestMinds in 2020 under the mentorship of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikhail-sidyakov/" target="_blank">Mikhail Sidyakov</a> to further expand my base knowledge of data science, and to be prepared navigating the competitive STEM job market.
